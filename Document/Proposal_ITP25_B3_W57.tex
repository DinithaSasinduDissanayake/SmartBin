1.Background 
SmartBin is a innovative web solution created for a new waste management company in Sri 
Lanka. We specialize in garbage collection services, and SmartBin is a digital hub to connect 
customers, staff, recyclers, and management. Our main focus is on three key areas: industrial 
facilities, commercial businesses (especially in the hotel and restaurant sector), and upscale 
residential neighborhoods. 
Right now, the waste management system in Sri Lanka tends to be quite costly and ineffective 
for these customer groups, causing delays and missing the personalized features that 
businesses and affluent residential clients really need. This gap in service quality gives us a 
fantastic opportunity to bring a fresh approach to waste management. 
SmartBin offers a complete digital ecosystem with five key features: user and staff 
management, financial management, recycling management, pickup request management, and 
schedule/resource management. All these functions work smoothly together to reduce manual 
tasks, cut administrative costs, and enhance communication among everyone involved in the 
waste disposal process. 
Our client is an ambitious entrepreneur diving into the waste management scene, and they 
know that a strong digital solution is essential for success in this competitive market. The initial 
strategy is to work alongside current municipal waste services while addressing the specific 
needs of our target groups. Our value proposition emphasizes responsiveness, customization, 
and efficiency—elements that traditional services often lack. As SmartBin strengthens its 
market presence and operational capabilities, we plan to gradually branch out to serve 
additional customer groups beyond our initial focus, creating a scalable business model in this 
important but underserved sector.

2.Problem and Motivation 
2.1 Problem 
2.1.1. Problem Statement 
Sri Lanka's waste management systems are struggling right now with major 
inefficiencies, lack of transparency, poor communication, and underutilization of data. 
These challenges not only drive up operational costs but also harm the environment and 
leave users feeling frustrated. 
2.1.2. Current Problems 
    2.1.2.1. User Experience Issues 
People often have to call or visit offices just to make simple requests like scheduling a 
pickup or adjusting collection frequency. 
No Easy Feedback: There aren’t effective digital channels for users to give feedback, file 
complaints, or track services, which means they have to rely on phone calls and face-to-
face visits. 
Missing Reporting Tools: Business customers can’t get the waste management reports 
they need for compliance and sustainability efforts. 
Poor Complaint Resolution: Customer issues often go unresolved because tracking 
systems and accountability measures are lacking. 
    2.1.2.2 Operational Inefficiencies: 
Attendance Challenges: Collection workers frequently skip busy days while showing up 
on slower days, leading to inconsistent service quality. 
Manual Task Assignments: Supervisors are spending too much time on task allocations 
that could easily be automated, which decreases productivity. 
Inefficient Resource Use: Poor routing and scheduling waste fuel, increase wear on 
vehicles, and hamper team efficiency. 
Irregular Collections: Bad scheduling can result in missed pickups and overflowing bins 
for both residential and commercial areas.    
    2.1.2.3 Financial and System Limitations: 
High Costs, Low Value: Traditional systems are pricey but miss out on modern features 
that would make them worth the cost. 
Financial Inefficiencies: Manual billing and reporting processes are error-prone, slow, 
and lead to revenue losses. 

\section*{Page 8}

Unmet Industrial Needs: There's no specialized dashboards or tools available for 
industrial clients to optimize their waste management strategies. 
Fragmented Recycling Processes: Difficulties in connecting waste producers with 
recyclers limit effective waste diversion. 
Lack of Collection Transparency: Without real-time tracking for collection requests, 
users face uncertainty and frustration. 
 
    2.1.3 Current Process 
Customer Interactions: Mostly through phone calls or in-person visits to offices, which 
slows down communication and creates bottlenecks. 
Service Management: Complaints are handled using paper forms or basic phone logs, 
which leads to lost information and inconsistent follow-ups. 
Financial Operations: Billing, invoicing, and payroll are managed manually, resulting in 
high error rates and inefficient reconciliation. 
Logistics Planning: Using paper-based schedules and routes for collection teams creates 
inefficiencies and missed collections. 
Recycling Management: Users need to independently find recycling centers with little 
guidance or support. 
 Information Flow: Communication between users, staff, and management is 
fragmented, lacking a centralized information system. 
2.2. Motivation 
    2.2.1. For Clients/Business 
The implementation of a digital waste management platform presents significant 
operational and financial advantages for our client's business. By adopting automated 
scheduling and optimized routing algorithms, operational costs can be substantially 
reduced through more efficient fuel usage, vehicle maintenance, and labor allocation. 
The improved service quality resulting from this optimization will directly enhance 
customer satisfaction and retention rates, creating a stable revenue base in an 
increasingly competitive market. Perhaps most valuable in the long term, the platform 
will generate comprehensive data-driven insights enabling informed strategic decisions 
about service expansion, resource allocation, and business growth. This technological 
approach offers a distinct competitive advantage in Sri Lanka's emerging digital waste 
management market, positioning our client as an innovative industry leader. 

\section*{Page 9}

Additionally, enhanced financial tracking and reporting capabilities will provide greater 
visibility into business performance, supporting better cash flow management, 
profitability analysis, and financial planning. 
    2.2.2. For Staff 
The digital platform will transform the daily work experience of employees across all 
organizational levels. Administrative staff will benefit from streamlined workflows that 
eliminate redundant data entry and manual record keeping, allowing them to focus on 
higher-value tasks and customer service. Collection teams will receive clear, optimized 
task assignments and efficient scheduling through mobile applications, improving work 
efficiency and reducing frustration from poorly planned routes. The implementation of a 
performance-based incentive system, made possible through digital tracking and 
analytics, will increase motivation and recognize high performers, fostering a more 
engaged workforce. The platform will establish better communication channels for 
promptly reporting operational issues and receiving timely updates, creating a more 
connected work environment. Finally, digital tracking of attendance and leave 
management will ensure appropriate staffing levels for operational needs while 
providing greater transparency and fairness in workforce management. 
    2.2.3 For Customers 
Our target customers, industrial facilities, food service establishments, and high-income 
residential areas—will experience transformative benefits that directly address their 
current pain points. The convenient digital platform will eliminate bureaucratic hurdles 
for service requests and tracking, allowing customers to manage their waste services 
through intuitive web and mobile interfaces. Transparent pricing models and real-time 
status updates on collection requests will provide unprecedented visibility into service 
delivery, building trust and customer confidence. Business customers will gain easy 
access to comprehensive waste management reports and service history, supporting 
their compliance requirements and sustainability initiatives. For environmentally 
conscious customers, the simplified recycling process offers both environmental 
benefits and potential monetary incentives for recyclable materials. The overall 
improvement in communication with service providers will create a responsive, 
customer-oriented waste management experience that stands in stark contrast to the 
current system's limitations. 
    2.2.4 Environmental Impact 
Beyond business and customer benefits, the platform will deliver significant positive 
environmental outcomes for Sri Lankan communities. More reliable collection services 
and transparent scheduling will reduce illegal dumping currently plaguing many 

\section*{Page 10}

neighborhoods, improving public health and urban aesthetics. The simplified and 
incentivized recycling processes will substantially increase recycling rates, diverting 
valuable materials from landfills and extending their useful life. Optimized collection 
routes generated through sophisticated algorithms will lower the carbon footprint of 
waste management operations through reduced fuel consumption and vehicle 
emissions. The system will encourage better waste segregation practices through 
education and incentives, promoting more sustainable disposal methods and supporting 
circular economy principles. Collectively, these environmental benefits align with 
national sustainability goals while creating healthier, cleaner communities across service 
areas.

4.System Overview [with System Diagram] 
4.1 Introduction to System  
The SmartBin Management System is designed as a comprehensive digital ecosystem that 
integrates five core functional modules to create a seamless waste management operation. The 

\section*{Page 14}
   
 
 14  
 
system architecture follows a modern web-based approach that enables real-time data 
exchange between different stakeholders including customers, staff, management, and 
recycling partners. The system is built on a client-server architecture with a centralized 
database, RESTful API services, and specialized functional modules that together form a 
complete waste management solution. 
 
  
 
  Figure 1: SmartBin Management System Architecture (See Appendix for full-size diagram) 
 
As illustrated in the system diagram, the SmartBin Management System's architecture centers 
around five interconnected functional modules that share data through a unified API layer. The 
User and Staff Management module serves as the access control and profile management hub, 
authenticating all system interactions and maintaining user permissions. The Financial 
Management module processes all monetary transactions, drawing data from other modules to 
generate invoices, managing subscriptions, and process payroll. The Recycling Management 
module interfaces with both customers and recycling partners to facilitate waste valuation and 
exchange. The Pickup Request Management module handles the customer-facing service 
requests and coordinates with the Schedule and Resource Management module, which 
optimizes fleet operations and resource allocation. All modules access a centralized MongoDB 
database through secure API endpoints, while external integration points allow for payment 
processing, geolocation services, and analytics capabilities.

4.2 Functional Requirements 
4.2.1 User and Staff Management 
The User and Staff Management System plays a key role in the "SmartBin" platform. It controls 
system users, such as customers, staff along with administrators. The function aims to offer a 
clear, secure, simple experience while keeping strong administrative control plus operational 
oversight. 
 
User Registration and Authentication 
 
The system uses a secure registration process made for various user groups. Staff or 
administrators can register through a clear interface that offers 
Secure Registration: It captures user data correctly and safely using encryption during data 
transfer. 
Multi-Factor Authentication: It adds an extra security step by combining password checks with 
other verification methods like SMS or email codes to lower the risk of unauthorized access. 
Role-Based Access Control: It lets administrators set specific access rights for each user role so 
users see only the functions relevant to their tasks. 
Account Management: Functions such as password recovery with self-service account update 
let users keep their credentials current without help from others. 
 
Profile Management 
 
This part of the system handles complete profile control where users can create, view, update 
or remove records 
Customer Profiles: They list service location, user choices plus payment information so the 
experience becomes more tailored. 
Staff Profiles: They list details about skills, availability next to performance metrics. Extra 
options let users upload documents to quickly prove certifications or identification. 
4.2.2 Financial Management System 
Dashboard for Finances 

\section*{Page 16}
   
 
 16  
 
This part shows current financial numbers. It gives simple views of income, expenses along with 
cash flow plans. Users choose periods and numbers for reports. 
 
Handling Subscriptions 
This function lets managers set up and change subscription plans. It takes care of billing cycles 
without manual work. It tracks what each customer has and lets users change plans with proper 
billing for each change. 
 
Managing Invoices and Payments 
This section creates bills based on the services used. It accepts several ways for customers to 
pay such as credit cards, bank transfers or mobile money. It sends reminders when payments 
are due and follows up as needed while giving receipts when payments are made. 
 
Payroll Services 
This section calculates workers' pay including extra amounts where needed. It manages taxes 
and other deductions. It mixes in bonuses easily. It produces pay statements that go to each 
worker. 
 
Financial Statements 
This part makes full reports on the finances. It creates reports that follow tax rules. It looks at 
money in from each type of service and the different groups of customers. It also sorts 
expenses into different groups. 
 
Problem and Motivation 
The current system for financial work in waste management falls short. It does not give quick, 
updated views of financial progress. There is no good method to check monthly or yearly 
income or see where that money comes from. Problems exist in planning monthly costs, 
especially in handling worker pay, which is done in separate systems. It also lacks a system for 
subscription plans. The system lets manual work, slow invoice creation along with delays in 
payroll slow things down. 

\section*{Page 17}

4.2.3 Recycling Management Platform 
This section focuses on the management of purchasing recyclable waste from the system. The 
system is designed to streamline the recycling process by providing recyclers with easy access 
to available waste materials and allowing them to request purchases efficiently. By centralizing 
the selling process under the administrator’s control, the system ensures a structured and well-
regulated waste distribution process. This approach enhances reliability, maintains quality 
standards, and promotes a sustainable recycling ecosystem. 
 
Actors Involved: 
 
Recyclers – Users who are interested in purchasing waste materials for recycling purposes. 
 
Administrator – The entity responsible for managing the selling of recyclable waste, updating 
stock availability, and processing purchase requests. 
Functionalities within this Scope: 
 
The administrator uploads recyclable waste materials into the system, with information such as 
waste type, quantity, price, and availability. 
 
Recyclers can search for available types of waste using the system. 
 
Recyclers can post requests to purchase waste based on availability and their recycling needs. 
 
The administrator reviews and accepts/rejects purchase requests based on inventory levels and 
system policies. 
 
Once a request is approved, the transaction is processed, and collection or delivery details are 
sent to the recycler. 
 

\section*{Page 18}
   
 
 18  
 
The administrator maintains transaction records and generates reports on waste purchases and 
sales. 
 
System Benefits and Impact 
 
Upon reviewing current waste management systems, we realized that most of them either do 
not have an organized waste-selling system or support multiple sellers, which results in waste 
availability and price inconsistencies. Centralizing the process of selling waste under the 
administrator's authority, our system guarantees: 
 
Reliable waste availability – There is a listing of only real waste materials. 
 
Equitable and transparent pricing – The administrator controls prices to maintain consistency. 
 
Efficient purchase management – Orders are processed in an organized manner without direct 
involvement of sellers. 
 
Detailed tracking and reporting – The administrator can provide reports on total waste sales, 
purchases by recyclers, and overall impact of recycling. 
 
Systemized management makes the system more efficient and functional and promotes 
efficient recycling processes. Recyclers feel secure in placing orders for the materials they need 
because the process is efficiently carried out by the owner of the system. 
4.2.4 Pickup Request Management System 
This chapter explains how to handle garbage pickup requests using this system. The system 
helps the waste collection process work faster by letting users submit pickup requests while the 
administrator easily manages them. By keeping all pickup requests in one place, the system 
improves organization, speeds up responses along with better controls waste collection 
resulting in a greener, cleaner environment. 
 

\section*{Page 19}
   
 
 19  
 
Actors Involved 
Users – Individuals or groups who submit garbage pickup requests. 
Administrator – The person who reviews, handles next to sets pickup appointments for smooth 
garbage collection. 
Functionalities within this Scope 
Users submit garbage pickup requests by completing a form with their name, phone, email, 
community, waste type, chosen date, location. 
The administrator accepts, processes along with checks pickup requests. 
If the pickup location falls within the service area, the request continues with further steps. 
4.2.5 Schedule and Resource Management System 
This section deals with planning garbage collection and using available trucks, tools, equipment 
well. The system makes sure that garbage pickup follows a clear plan, resources serve their 
purpose, while upkeep follows a set timetable. Centralized planning improves work flow, cuts 
idle time, which results in smooth garbage collection. 
 
Actors Involved 
 
‒ Garbage Collectors – Workers who pick up waste along set routes. 
‒ Administrators – Set schedules, assign trucks, share resources, while keeping up maintenance. 
 
Functionalities within this Scope 
 
‒ The administrator gives garbage pickup tasks by planning routes from preset options and 
service requests. 
‒ The system lets one check garbage trucks by grouping them according to their state.

5.6. Summary and Justification 
The literature review reveals that existing solutions in the waste management domain are 
highly specialized—addressing single functions such as pickup requests, fleet scheduling, HR 
management, financial operations, or recycling. However, they exhibit several critical 
limitations: 
 
- Fragmentation:   
  - Systems are often designed for specific segments (e.g., municipal operations or commercial 
clients) and lack integration across the entire waste management lifecycle. 
 
- High Costs and Complexity:   
  - Advanced solutions like Rubicon or Workday provide robust functionalities but come with 
high implementation costs and complex integrations that may not be feasible in all regions. 
 
- Limited Scope:   
  - Many systems target a narrow set of functions (e.g., plastic recycling or basic HR 
management) and do not address the holistic needs of both large-scale and small-scale users. 

\section*{Page 34}
   
 
 34
