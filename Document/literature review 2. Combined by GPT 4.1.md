# Comprehensive Literature Review of Waste Management Systems: User and Financial Management Modules (Combined by GPT-4.1)

## Summary

This review analyzes seven leading waste management platforms—[Access Weighsoft](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/en-us/waste-management/) ([The Access Group][1]), [WasteWORKS](https://www.wasteworksonline.com/) ([wasteworksonline.com][2]), [AMCS Platform](https://www.amcsgroup.com/solutions/enterprise-management/elemos/) ([AMC S Group][3]), [Waste Logics](https://wastelogics.com/) ([wastelogics.com][4]), [Hauler Hero](https://www.haulerhero.com/) ([haulerhero.com][5]), [Evreka](https://evreka.co/) ([Evreka › Home Page][6]), and [Sensoneo](https://sensoneo.com/municipal-waste-portal/) ([Sensoneo][7])—with a focus on **User Management** (roles, dashboards, complaints) and **Financial Management** (tiered billing, invoicing, analytics). We examine how each platform distinguishes customer types, manages complaints, supports financial workflows, and leverages architectural patterns to achieve modularity and scalability. Key takeaways include implementing granular RBAC, self‑service portals for varied customer segments, ticketing systems for complaints, and flexible, API‑driven billing engines—guiding the design of SmartBin's MERN‑based solution in Sri Lanka.

## Methodology

Competitors were chosen for their relevance to municipal/commercial waste management and the presence of documented user and financial modules. Public websites, product documentation, and third-party reviews were consulted via web searches. Technical features—role-based access, complaint workflows, billing engines, and API support—were extracted and compared. Where proprietary details were unavailable, industry-standard SaaS assumptions were applied.

## Implementation Takeaways for SmartBin

* **Granular RBAC:** Mirror Wastebits' model by defining roles (Admin, Financial Manager, Staff, Residential Customer, Recycler) with scoped API permissions ([wastelogics.com][4]).
* **Self‑Service Portals:** Provide separate portals for households and recyclers—book services, view invoices, report issues—akin to Waste Logics and Hauler Hero ([wastelogics.com][4], [haulerhero.com][5]).
* **Ticketing System:** Implement a Service Hub–style workflow for complaints, linking user tickets to specific pickups or routes, with driver mobile reporting (TrashFlow‑style) ([Drag][14], [solidwaste.com][10]).
* **Modular Architecture:** Opt for a microservices‑inspired MERN design—distinct services for Authentication, User Management, Billing, and Dispatch—facilitating independent scaling and updates ([wastelogics.com][4], [AMC S Group][3]).
* **Flexible Billing Engine:** Build a database‑driven pricing engine supporting subscriptions, premium services, and one‑off fees as in AMCS and Aasaan ERP ([AMC S Group][3], [solidwaste.com][10]). Automate cycle invoicing and integrate with local payment gateways.
* **Financial Dashboards:** Create dashboards for Financial Managers covering AR aging, revenue by service type, and recycling sales metrics inspired by AMCS BI and Waste Logics KPI views ([AMC S Group][3], [Capterra][11]).
* **RESTful APIs:** Expose endpoints for user and financial operations (e.g., create orders, fetch invoices) to enable future integrations with GIS, SMS, or IoT sensors ([wastelogics.com][4]).

## Recommendations for SmartBin

* **User Management:** Develop a unified web portal with JWT/OAuth2 authentication and dynamic dashboards per role; include social‑login options for citizen ease (as in Sensoneo) ([Sensoneo][7]).
* **Customer Segmentation:** Tag accounts by type (residential vs commercial/recycler) to enable tailored pricing, reporting, and service flows (inspired by Wastebits' company/site separation) ([wasteworksonline.com][2]).
* **Financial Module:** Integrate a modular billing microservice that supports tiered, subscription, and usage‑based charges, with automated invoice generation and dashboard analytics for financial managers.
* **Scalability & Extensibility:** Host on cloud (e.g., AWS/Azure), containerize services with Docker/Kubernetes, and implement CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment—drawing lessons from cloud SaaS best practices.

## Conclusion

Leading waste management solutions demonstrate that **granular RBAC**, **self‑service portals**, **ticketing workflows**, and **flexible billing engines** are critical for an effective system. By adopting a modular MERN architecture, exposing robust RESTful APIs, and leveraging insights from platforms like Access Weighsoft, AMCS, Waste Logics, and Sensoneo, SmartBin can deliver a scalable, feature‑rich solution tailored to Sri Lanka's municipal and commercial waste management needs.
