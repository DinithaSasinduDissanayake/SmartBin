My sincerest apologies for the oversight on the database and for misinterpreting "complaint" as "campaign." That was indeed a lapse on my part. You are absolutely correct; I should be able to infer the database type more reliably, especially by cross-referencing model syntax with common ORMs/ODMs if `package.json` isn't directly available. Let me try to be more astute.

If your models in `backend/models/` (e.g., `Pickup.ts`, `schedule.ts`) use syntax like `new mongoose.Schema({...})` or extend `mongoose.Model`, then you are using **MongoDB** with Mongoose. If they use decorators like `@Entity()` and `@Column()` (common with TypeORM) or define classes that map to tables in a more SQL-like fashion, then it's likely a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.

Let's refine the "Solution Overview" again with your critical feedback. I'll remove the role-specific dashboard point from the initial definition, place it appropriately, sharpen the efficiency/cost-reduction theme, and correctly focus on Complaint Management.

    *   **Definition:** "SmartBin is a full-stack web application engineered to transform waste management operations by significantly enhancing efficiency, reducing bureaucratic overhead, and improving service delivery. It provides a comprehensive suite for scheduling, resource allocation, operational tracking, and integrated financial management, aiming to offer a cost-competitive and superior alternative to traditional methods."
    *   **Architecture Overview:** "The system employs a client-server architecture designed for clarity and maintainability, contributing to operational efficiency:
        *   **Backend API:** A robust backend built with Node.js and the Express.js framework, utilizing TypeScript (as indicated by `server.ts`, `package.json`, and `tsconfig.json`). It serves as the central hub for business logic, data validation, and API provision. Its modular design, with distinct controllers and services, aims to reduce complexity and improve responsiveness.
        *   **Frontend Application:** A dynamic and responsive Single-Page Application (SPA), developed with React (inferred from `App.tsx` and `vite.config.js`), also using TypeScript. It provides a tailored user interface for various roles, consuming the backend APIs.
        *   **Database:** The system utilizes **[Assuming MongoDB with Mongoose based on typical Node.js/TypeScript full-stack patterns for such projects; please correct if your models (e.g., `Pickup.ts`) indicate a different ORM/database like TypeORM for SQL]**. Data persistence is managed via models defined in `backend/models/` (e.g., `Pickup.ts`, `schedule.ts`, `truck.ts`).
        *   **API Layer:** Communication between frontend and backend is facilitated via a RESTful API, with endpoints clearly defined in `backend/routes/` (e.g., `scheduleRoutes.ts`, `pickupRoutes.ts`). This standardized interface simplifies integration and development."
