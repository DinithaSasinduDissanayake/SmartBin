**2.2 Report formatting**

*   **General formatting**
    *   Page size: A4
    *   Margins: default margins
    *   Normal font: Times New Roman
    *   Normal font size: 11
    *   Line spacing: Multiple at 1.2
    *   Paragraph alignment: Justify
    *   Page numbering: On the center of the footer. Refer to the other formatting sections below for more page numbering formats.
    *   All the figures and tables should use proper captions. Make sure to use specific names rather than generic names. For example, use "Sequence diagram of login process" instead of "Sequence diagram".
    *   Table captions should be placed before the table and the figure captions should be placed after the figure.
    *   Figures and tables should be numbered based on the chapter number, starting from 1 in each chapter. For example, the number of the first figure in the chapter 3 should be "Figure 3.1: ".
    *   Make sure the text size in the figures is close to the paragraph text size, thus, they are readable.
*   **Headings (Use the styles in MS Word)**
    *   Section/Chapter heading (Heading 1): 16, Bold, Center, Lower border

    *   Title page – May use a border only on the title page. Do not include a page number. Refer to the sample title page in appendix 1.
    *   Page numbering should be included from the page next to the title page. Start the page numbering from i (one, in lower case roman numbering)
*   **Body section**
    *   Include page numbering from the first page of the first chapter. Restart page numbering from Arabic 1.
    *   Include the chapter number and name on the right-side of the page header except the first page of the chapter (you need to use proper section breaks to do this).
