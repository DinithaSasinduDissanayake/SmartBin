okay here is the deal now 

my all three team members have pushed their code to the github

so i am tasked with integrating all the code and making sure everything works

first i want you to give me various git commands to run so that i can give a llm those outputs as context 

then i want you to rund bunch of commands to get a idea about the state of the remote repo 


dont run any commands that make changes all the commands should be stuff that are used to get information about the state of the repo 


===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

i am supposed to integrate this system and create a final product within 6 hours 

i ran bunch of git commands so that i can give you the output and you can  get a idea about the state of the repo

are there any other commands you want me to run and give you the output of

here are the commands i ran and their output

okay here is the deal i tried to migrate to shadcn but failed then i reverted to a previous commit thinking that commit didi have shacd cn 

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

okay i have decided not to use shadcn 

i want to integrate other module to the version that didnt have shadcn

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

here is the output of git diff develop origin/dhanushka > dhanushka-diff.txt

what can you tell about what dhanushka has done and what are the differences between my version and his version . what do i have to get all of his changes and integrate them into my version and make them function properly like they did in his version

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Okay, let's break down this `git diff` output.

**Summary of Dhanushka's Changes:**

Dhanushka appears to have performed a **major refactoring or partial rewrite**, focusing on specific new features while removing a large portion of the existing codebase structure and features within their branch (`origin/dhanushka`).

Here's a breakdown of what Dhanushka seems to have done compared to your `develop` branch:

1.  **Backend Rewrite to TypeScript:**
    *   **Deleted Existing JS Backend:** Removed almost the entire `backend/src` directory, including controllers, models (User, Payment, Subscription, etc.), routes, services, error handling, and the JavaScript `server.js`.
    *   **Added TypeScript Backend:** Introduced a new, smaller backend structure using TypeScript (`.ts` files). This includes a new `server.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and new models/routes.
    *   **Changed Dependencies:** Significantly altered backend `package.json`.
        *   **Removed:** Many dependencies related to the old features were removed (Stripe, PDFKit, QR code, validation, security middleware like `hpp`, `xss-clean`, `mongo-sanitize`, pagination helpers, Jest testing tools, etc.).
        *   **Added:** Added `nodemailer` (for email), `typescript`, `ts-node`, and various `@types/*` packages for TypeScript support.
    *   **New Scripts:** Updated `package.json` scripts for TypeScript (using `ts-node` and `tsc`).

2.  **Added New Features (Backend):**
    *   **Resource Management:** Added new Mongoose models (`Truck`, `Equipment`, `Tool`) and corresponding API routes (`resourceRoutes.ts`, `equipmentRoutes.ts`, `toolRoutes.ts`) in TypeScript to manage these resources. These models include fields like location (lat/lng), status, capacity, etc.
    *   **Schedule Management:** Added a new `Schedule` model and API routes (`scheduleRoutes.ts`, `customer-schedules.ts`) in TypeScript. This includes logic for creating, viewing, updating, deleting schedules and potentially fetching schedules for customers based on the current date.
    *   **Email Notifications:** Added utility files (`email.ts`, `email.d.ts`) using Nodemailer, likely for sending notifications related to the new schedule features.

3.  **Frontend Changes:**
    *   **Added Google Maps:** Added `@react-google-maps/api` as a root dependency, suggesting integration of Google Maps into the frontend (likely to display truck/equipment locations). *The diff doesn't show the specific frontend components using this, only the dependency change.*

4.  **Codebase Cleanup & Configuration:**
    *   **Deleted Documentation/Logs:** Removed `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `Diary by copilot.md`, `prompts.md`, `changes-summary.txt`. These seem like development notes or auto-generated files.
    *   **Deleted Backup Code:** Removed the entire `Financial Backup` directory.
    *   **Deleted Incorrect Folder:** Removed a nested `frontend` directory inside the `backend` directory (`backend/frontend`).
    *   **Updated `.gitignore`:** Replaced the existing `.gitignore` with a more comprehensive, standard one for Node.js/React projects.
    *   **Removed `concurrently`:** Removed the root-level script and dependency for running frontend and backend together with one command.
    *   **Updated `README.md`:** Significantly shortened and rewrote the README, focusing on basic setup and mentioning TypeScript/Nodemailer.

**Differences Between Your Version (develop) and Dhanushka's Version (origin/dhanushka):**

*   **Backend Language:** Yours is JavaScript; Dhanushka's is primarily TypeScript (focused on new features).
*   **Backend Features:**
    *   **Yours:** Contains the full suite of original features (authentication including MFA, payments with Stripe, payroll, performance, documents, complaints, user subscriptions, etc.).
    *   **Dhanushka's:** Lacks most original backend features. Contains *new* features for managing Trucks, Equipment, Tools, and Schedules, plus email sending.
*   **Dependencies:** Your `package.json` (backend) has many more dependencies related to security, payments, validation, testing, etc. Dhanushka's has fewer overall but includes TypeScript-specific ones and Nodemailer.
*   **Testing:** Your version likely has a Jest testing setup (`jest.config.js`, dev dependencies); Dhanushka's version removed this.
*   **Frontend:** Dhanushka's version added the Google Maps dependency. Yours doesn't have it (based on this diff).
*   **Configuration:** Dhanushka updated `.gitignore` and removed the backend `.env.example`.
*   **Documentation:** Your version has the detailed project guidelines and possibly other notes; Dhanushka's version removed these. Your README is more detailed.
*   **Development Scripts:** Your version might use `concurrently`; Dhanushka's version uses simpler direct `npm start/dev` scripts in the root `package.json`.

**How to Get Dhanushka's Changes and Integrate Them:**

This is tricky because Dhanushka's branch *removes* a lot of code/features present in your `develop` branch. A direct merge (`git merge origin/dhanushka`) would likely delete large parts of your existing backend.

**Recommended Strategy: Careful Integration**

You need to selectively bring Dhanushka's *new* additions into your existing `develop` codebase without accepting the deletions of your current features.

1.  **Backup Your Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b develop-backup-before-dhanushka
    ```

2.  **Fetch Latest Changes:**
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```

3.  **Identify Dhanushka's New Files/Code:**
    *   The new TypeScript files in `backend/models/`, `backend/routes/`, `backend/utils/`.
    *   The new `backend/server.ts` and `backend/tsconfig.json`.
    *   The changes in the root `package.json` (adding `@react-google-maps/api`).
    *   The changes in the root `.gitignore`.
    *   The changes in the backend `package.json` (adding `nodemailer`, TypeScript dependencies, and changing scripts).

4.  **Integrate Selectively (Choose ONE method):**

    *   **Method A: Cherry-Picking (If commits are clean):**
        *   Review Dhanushka's commit history: `git log origin/dhanushka --oneline --graph`
        *   Identify the specific commit hashes that *only* add the new features (models, routes, email, maps dependency) and update `.gitignore`. Be very careful *not* to pick commits that delete your existing code.
        *   Checkout your develop branch: `git checkout develop`
        *   Apply those specific commits: `git cherry-pick <commit_hash_1> <commit_hash_2> ...`
        *   Resolve any conflicts carefully. This might be difficult if Dhanushka also modified files you changed.

    *   **Method B: Manual Copying & Adaptation (Likely Safer but More Work):**
        *   Checkout Dhanushka's branch temporarily to easily copy files: `git checkout origin/dhanushka`
        *   Copy the *new* directories/files Dhanushka added:
            *   `backend/models/equipment.ts`
            *   `backend/models/schedule.ts`
            *   `backend/models/tool.ts`
            *   `backend/models/truck.ts`
            *   `backend/routes/customer-schedules.ts`
            *   `backend/routes/equipmentRoutes.ts`
            *   `backend/routes/resourceRoutes.ts`
            *   `backend/routes/scheduleRoutes.ts`
            *   `backend/routes/toolRoutes.ts`
            *   `backend/utils/email.ts`
            *   `backend/utils/email.d.ts`
            *   `backend/tsconfig.json`
            *   `backend/server.ts` (You'll likely need to merge this logic into your existing `server.js`, not replace it directly).
        *   Switch back to your develop branch: `git checkout develop`
        *   Paste the copied files into the corresponding locations in your `backend/src` structure.
        *   **Adaptation:**
            *   **TypeScript Setup:** You need to set up TypeScript in your *existing* `develop` backend.
                *   Add the TypeScript dev dependencies from Dhanushka's `backend/package.json` to yours (`typescript`, `ts-node`, `@types/*`).
                *   Add the `tsconfig.json`.
                *   Update your backend `package.json` scripts to include a build step (`tsc`) and potentially use `ts-node` for development if desired.
            *   **Integrate Routes:** Modify your existing `backend/src/server.js` (or rename it to `.ts` and adapt) to import and use the *new* routes from `backend/src/routes` (e.g., `app.use('/api', resourceRoutes)`). Do *not* simply replace your `server.js` with Dhanushka's `server.ts` as yours contains setup for all your existing features.
            *   **Integrate Email:** Add `nodemailer` to your backend dependencies. Ensure the `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables are set up (you might need to add them to your `.env.example` and `.env`).
            *   **Models:** Ensure the new TypeScript models work with your Mongoose setup.
            *   **Frontend Maps:** Add `@react-google-maps/api` to your *root* `package.json` dependencies. You'll then need to find where Dhanushka used this in the frontend code (this diff doesn't show that) and implement the map components. You'll also need a Google Maps API Key set up in your frontend environment variables (e.g., `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`).
            *   **`.gitignore`:** Manually compare your `.gitignore` with Dhanushka's version and merge the changes, keeping the best parts of both (likely most of Dhanushka's is better).
            *   **Dependencies:** Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) in the `backend` directory and the root directory to install all necessary packages.

5.  **Build and Test:**
    *   If you integrated TypeScript, run the backend build command (e.g., `npm run build` inside `backend`).
    *   Start both frontend and backend (`npm run dev` in the root, assuming you keep `concurrently` or adapt Dhanushka's simpler scripts).
    *   **Crucially, test EVERYTHING:**
        *   Test all your original features (login, registration, payments, payroll, etc.) to ensure they weren't broken.
        *   Test Dhanushka's new features (creating/viewing trucks, equipment, schedules, tools).
        *   Test the email sending functionality.
        *   Test the Google Maps integration on the frontend (once implemented).

6.  **Commit:** Once everything works, commit the changes to your `develop` branch.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Communication:** Talk to Dhanushka! Understand why they removed so much code. Was it intentional? Was this branch just for experimenting with the new features in isolation? Merging might not be the right approach if their goal wasn't integration yet.
*   **TypeScript:** Integrating the new TypeScript code requires setting up TypeScript compilation for your backend if you haven't already. This involves adding dev dependencies and configuring `tsconfig.json`.
*   **Complexity:** This is not a straightforward merge due to the deletions. The manual integration approach (Method B) is likely safer but requires significant effort to adapt the new code and ensure compatibility.
*   **Testing:** Rigorous testing after integration is essential to catch any broken functionality.

isnt there a easier way to do this 

currently i am using vs code and copilot for most of coding like that can i instruct a llm to bring all the functionality of dhanushka's code into my code without having to do all this manually

or can i do something like duplicating dhanushka's branch then mergin develop into it and then merging that branch into develop

i personally dont have the ability to manage merge conflicts competently without the help of a llm

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

so the thing is dhanushka is actually not that good at git 

what he has done is he has developed his feature in his own project and then pushed it to his branch 

what is the easiest way to get his code into my branch

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

okay here is the deal i am developing a website for a module called itp in my degree program

it is a garbage management website 

it has a landing page then a login page 

then based on the user type it goes to different dashboards

there are 4 dashboards and 4 user types

    1. admin
    2. financial manager
    3. staff
    4. customer
 
in these dashboard there is a sidebar . and in the sidebar there are buttons and when clicked on the right side of the screen the content changes based on the button clicked

that is the basic architecture of the website

so our team members are developing different features but they are not devided like admin dashboard is developed by one person and financial manager dashboard is developed by another person . some people are developing features for few dashboards .

so the thing is our team is new to git and they have not used git the way it is supposed to be used

what they have done is created their own projects locally then developed sidebars and stuff then added buttons related to their features in the sidebar and got it working 
then pushed it to their branch
then i am supposed to integrate all of this into one final product


so now i am tasked to do is get all of the features they have developed and integrate them into my version of the project and make sure everything works without breaking my stuff 

i have so far integrated one members stuff by taking file by file and copying it into my version of the project and making sure everything works





================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

how to use llm to speed up this process | i have vs code copilot pro 

how to use it to speed up this process | i dont know how to use github merge tool 

and also i am somewhat done with dhanushika's branch i want to merge (if merging is the best option) tharindu's branch into my branch without breaking my stuff . all i want to do is get his features into my branch and make sure everything works without breaking my stuff

so here is how i am planning to integrate those features 

first tharindu's branch to the develop branch

i am going to give the file structure and the code
